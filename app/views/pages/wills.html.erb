        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
          <p>Spanish succession law differs significantly from UK law, and without a Spanish will, your Spanish assets may not be distributed according to your wishes. Spanish forced heirship rules can override your UK will for Spanish assets, potentially leaving your spouse or chosen beneficiaries with less than intended. A properly drafted Spanish will ensures your Spanish property and assets are distributed according to your wishes while complying with Spanish law.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
          <p>Having a Spanish will also significantly speeds up the inheritance process, reducing bureaucracy, legal costs, and stress for your beneficiaries. Without a Spanish will, your family may face lengthy and expensive probate proceedings in Spain, potentially taking years to resolve. Our expert will services ensure your Spanish assets are protected and your family's inheritance process is as smooth as possible.</p>

          <p>Spanish law requires all short-term rental properties to have proper licensing before they can be legally advertised or rented to tourists. Operating without a valid VV license can result in significant fines, forced closure, and removal from booking platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com. The licensing process involves meeting specific safety, accessibility, and quality standards that vary by region and municipality.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
          <p>Spain’s property conveyancing system is very different from the UK’s, so having a qualified local lawyer is crucial. In Spain, buyers are expected to do thorough due diligence – checking for debts, building permits, and property registrations – before completing a sale. Without a lawyer, you risk overlooking critical issues. An experienced conveyancing solicitor will protect your interests at every step, ensuring there are no nasty surprises like inherited debts or illegal building work attached to the property.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
          <p>It’s strongly recommended (even by UK government guidance) to choose an independent Spanish property lawyer who represents only you (and not the seller or agent). Unlike in the UK, Spanish notaries are public officials who impartially oversee the signing of property deeds – they do not advise the buyer or verify if the property is problem-free. In other words, the notary formalizes the sale, but is not there to protect your personal interests. Only your own lawyer will conduct a full legal audit of the property and handle contract negotiations solely on your behalf. Some estate agents might tell foreign buyers that using a lawyer isn’t necessary – do not cut corners. Buying in Lanzarote is a significant investment, and proceeding without dedicated legal counsel is extremely risky. By engaging our independent conveyancing experts, you’ll avoid common pitfalls and have peace of mind that everything is done correctly and legally.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-12">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-Purchase Checks & Due Diligence:</strong> We rigorously investigate the property's legal status before you commit. This includes verifying the seller's title, ensuring the property is correctly registered, and checking for any debts, liens or unpaid taxes on the property. We confirm all necessary planning permissions and licenses are in order (for example, that any extensions or pools were built legally). This thorough due diligence means you won't unknowingly inherit hidden debts or legal problems along with the property. If any issues are found, we advise on solutions or negotiate with the seller to resolve them before you proceed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>NIE Number & Financial Setup:</strong> Foreign buyers in Spain must obtain a NIE (Número de Identificación de Extranjero) – a tax identification number required for any property purchase. We assist you in applying for your NIE as early as possible and can often expedite this process. We'll also help you set up a Spanish bank account and ensure you have the necessary funds in place for the deposit and purchase. Being prepared with a NIE and local bank account will enable a smooth transaction when you find your ideal property. (Tip: Having a Spanish account can save money on transfer fees and is useful for paying local bills and taxes.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contract Review & Deposit Handling:</strong> Once you've found the right property, we review or draft the private purchase contract (Contrato de Arras) in bilingual form (English/Spanish) for complete transparency. This preliminary contract sets out the terms of the sale and is accompanied by a reservation deposit, typically 10% of the purchase price. We explain all clauses to you and can negotiate terms to include any protections you need – for example, making the purchase conditional on obtaining a mortgage or a satisfactory survey. Nothing is signed or paid until you are comfortable with every detail. If a deposit is placed, we ensure it's held securely (often in the estate agent's or our client account) and that the contract clearly states what happens in the event of either party withdrawing (standard practice in Spain is that if the buyer pulls out without cause, they forfeit the deposit; if the seller pulls out, they must return double the deposit). We make sure you're protected in these scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Payments & Escrow Service:</strong> When it's time to make payments (such as the 10% deposit or the final purchase amount), we offer the use of our regulated client escrow account for secure fund transfers. You can send the funds to our escrow account in your home currency or in euros, and we will handle paying the seller or their notary at completion. Using our escrow service adds an extra layer of security and can save you money on international bank fees, since we can often avoid costly overseas transfer charges. It also means the seller only receives the money when all agreed conditions are met, protecting you as the buyer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Notary Coordination & Completion:</strong> We coordinate the final closing at the notary's office. Spanish law requires a notary public to formalize all real estate sales, and we will either accompany you to the notary or, if you prefer not to travel for completion, act on your behalf via a power of attorney. Before the notary day, we double-check that all conditions are fulfilled – for example, that any remaining questions have been answered and any issues uncovered in searches have been resolved by the seller. We ensure the seller has prepared all required certificates (like an Energy Performance Certificate and up-to-date utility and community fee receipts) so that no debts or bills are left unpaid on the property at handover. On the day of completion, we will review the new Title Deed (Escritura) for accuracy, ensure the correct amounts are paid and transferred, and that you receive the keys once the deed is signed. Our presence at the notary ensures your interests are represented during this formal step.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Post-Sale Registration & Taxes:</strong> After the notary signing, our job isn't over. We promptly register the property under your name at the Land Registry and pay the required purchase taxes on your behalf. In Lanzarote (Canary Islands), the main tax on buying a resale property is the Property Transfer Tax (ITP), which is 6.5% of the purchase price (notably lower than the ~10% rate in many parts of mainland Spain). If you're buying a newly built property, we ensure payment of the IGIC (VAT) instead (Canary Islands VAT is 7% for new builds). We also handle the Notary and Land Registry fees (typically around 1–2% combined) and the stamp duty (AJD) on the deed (around 0.75% in this region). We'll provide you with all the final invoices and receipts for these costs. Additionally, we can assist in setting up your ongoing obligations: for example, helping arrange automatic payments for your annual IBI municipal property tax and transferring utility bills into your name. Our comprehensive service means from start to finish, every legal detail is covered – so you can enjoy your new property worry-free.

        <p>If you are looking to sell your property in Lanzarote, our conveyancing experts offer end-to-end legal assistance to ensure a smooth sale. Spain’s selling process also has unique steps and obligations – we’ve got you covered on those as well:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-Sale Document Prep & Contract Advice:</strong> We guide you through all the paperwork needed to sell your property. This includes verifying your Title Deeds, obtaining an Energy Performance Certificate (legally required to sell in Spain), and gathering other relevant documents (such as community fee statements, latest utility bills, and any habitation license). When you find a buyer, we handle the negotiation and review of the reserve agreement or private sale contract. It’s critical to have your own lawyer draft or check the sales contract, rather than relying on the estate agent’s version. We ensure the terms (sale price, what fixtures/furnishings are included, completion deadline, etc.) are clearly defined and fair to you. We’ll also advise you on any “deposit contract” the buyer might sign. Typically, the buyer will pay a 10% deposit at contract exchange and, if they back out without cause, you keep that deposit; if you (the seller) back out, you might owe them double the deposit as penalty. We make sure you understand these implications before signing, and we can negotiate terms or add clauses to protect you (for instance, if you need flexibility on moving dates or want to sell “as-is” regarding certain property conditions).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Smooth Deal Management & Communication:</strong> Selling a property often involves coordination between multiple parties – the buyer (who may be foreign), their lawyer, estate agents, banks (if there’s a mortgage), and notaries. We act as your central point of contact to liaise with the buyer’s representatives and any third parties. Our team will keep you informed at every stage and handle any issues that arise, such as delays requested by the buyer or questions about the property. By having us manage the communication and paperwork, you avoid misunderstandings and last-minute surprises, ensuring the sale stays on track for the agreed completion date.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tax Planning & Calculation (Plusvalía and Capital Gains):</strong> We provide expert guidance on your tax obligations when selling. In Spain, the two main taxes for sellers are Plusvalía Municipal and Capital Gains Tax:<br>
            <em>Plusvalía Municipal:</em> A local municipal tax on the increase in the land value during your ownership. The town hall calculates this based on the property’s cadastral land value and the number of years you’ve owned it. We will calculate the expected Plusvalía for you ahead of time, so you know what to expect, and ensure it’s correctly paid to the local council after the sale. (Note: Plusvalía is usually paid by the seller under Spanish law, unless otherwise agreed.)<br>
            <em>Capital Gains Tax (CGT):</em> A tax on the profit you make from selling your property. We help you determine your taxable gain by factoring in allowable deductions (such as the original price you paid, costs of improvements, and legal fees/stamp duty from your purchase). For Spanish tax residents, capital gains are taxed on a sliding scale of 19% to 23%. For non-residents, the rate is 19% if you are an EU/EEA citizen, or 24% if you’re a non-EU citizen (for example, sellers from the UK now pay 24%). Our lawyers explain how these rates apply to your situation and explore any applicable exemptions (e.g. reinvestment in another Spanish property, or age-related exemptions). We aim to minimize your CGT legally by ensuring all eligible costs are deducted. After the sale, we can also help you file the necessary Spanish tax forms to declare your capital gain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3% Non-Resident Withholding Management:</strong> If you are not a tax resident in Spain at the time of selling (this often applies to British and other foreign owners who use their Lanzarote property as a holiday home), Spanish law requires the buyer to withhold 3% of the sale price and pay it directly to the tax authorities as a payment on account of your CGT. This is done using form 211 at the notary. We make sure this 3% withholding is correctly handled – protecting you from any liability if the buyer fails to pay it. After the sale, we will file your final capital gains tax return (form 210) to calculate the exact CGT due. If your actual CGT liability is less than the 3% that was withheld, you are entitled to a refund of the difference. We will handle the refund claim process for you, ensuring you get back any excess within the statutory time frame. (If the 3% didn’t fully cover your CGT because you made a large gain, we’ll calculate the additional amount you owe and arrange payment.) This entire process can be confusing, but with Roper Lawyers managing it, you can be confident it’s done right and that you won’t overpay tax.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Closing the Sale & After-Sale Support:</strong> Just as with buyers, we attend the notary with you (or on your behalf) on completion day to finalize the sale. Before the notary meeting, we obtain an updated mortgage payoff figure from your bank (if you have a mortgage) and coordinate with the buyer’s side to ensure the mortgage is discharged as part of the completion. At the notary, we make sure you receive the correct payment for your property – typically in the form of a banker’s draft or transfer for the remaining balance of the purchase price. We’ll oversee the signing of the new deed by you and the buyer, and only once funds are confirmed, you’ll hand over the keys. It’s our job to ensure everything is done correctly and fairly. You will be expected to provide proof that all recurring expenses (property tax, community fees, utility bills) are paid up to the date of sale, so we help gather those receipts for the notary. After completion, we continue to assist you: for example, we can help close out your Spanish bank account or cancel utilities that were in your name. We also verify that the property registry is updated to reflect the new owner (which protects you from any future liabilities on the property). Our goal is to make your exit as smooth as your entry – handling all the final loose ends so you can repatriate your funds or move on to your next venture without worries.

        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
            <h3 class="white-text">Can foreigners (British or Irish citizens) buy property in Lanzarote?</h3>
            <p class="white-text">Yes. Spain has no restrictions on foreign buyers purchasing property – whether it's residential, commercial, or land. In fact, Spain welcomes international investment in real estate. This means British and Irish citizens (as well as other nationalities) are free to buy property in Lanzarote. Even after Brexit, British buyers are still allowed to purchase property in Spain. However, it's important to note that buying property does not automatically grant you residency in Spain – if you're not an EU citizen (post-Brexit UK nationals, for example), you'll be subject to Spain's visa and immigration requirements if you plan to spend extended periods in Spain. Many Brits who move to Spain full-time do so on a Non-Lucrative Visa or Golden Visa, but you do not need to be a resident to simply buy. One legal requirement for all foreign buyers is to obtain a Spanish NIE number (Foreigner Identification Number) before completion of the purchase. The NIE is used on all property documents and tax filings. We assist our clients with the NIE application as part of our service. In summary, British and Irish citizens can absolutely buy property in Lanzarote – the process is open to you, just be mindful of the extra bureaucracy post-Brexit (which we can also help you navigate).</p>

            <h3 class="white-text">Do I need a lawyer to buy property in Lanzarote?</h3>
            <p class="white-text">While it's not a legal requirement to hire a lawyer when buying property in Spain, it is highly advisable to do so. Purchasing in Spain is quite different from the UK or Ireland, and having an expert on your side is invaluable. The UK Government strongly recommends using an independent Spanish lawyer for any property purchase in Spain. A good conveyancing lawyer will conduct thorough due diligence (something not done by any other party) and ensure the property is free of encumbrances, the contracts are fair, and your deposit and funds are protected. If you don't use a lawyer, you're relying on the estate agent (who works for the seller) and the notary (who is a neutral public official) – meaning no one is looking out exclusively for your interests. This can be very risky: without a lawyer's advice, you might inadvertently sign a contract that puts you at a disadvantage, or fail to discover debts or legal issues tied to the property. In the worst case, buyers who skipped independent legal advice have lost large deposits or bought properties that had serious problems (such as lack of planning permission or outstanding tax liens). A lawyer's fee is a small price to pay for peace of mind and protection of your investment. Remember, the notary is not a substitute for having your own solicitor – the notary's role is to verify the formalities and witness the signing, not to counsel the buyer on whether it's a good or safe deal. In summary, you are not legally forced to have a lawyer, but practically, it's essential to hire one. Our firm will make sure your purchase is secure and all legal requirements are met, sparing you from costly mistakes.</p>

            <h3 class="white-text">What are the costs and taxes when buying property in Lanzarote?</h3>
            <p class="white-text">When buying a property in Lanzarote, you should budget for roughly 8–10% on top of the purchase price to cover taxes and closing costs. The exact figure can vary depending on the purchase price and your situation, but here are the typical costs:</p>
            <ul>
            <li class="white-text"><strong>Transfer Tax (Impuesto de Transmisiones Patrimoniales, ITP):</strong> This is the largest cost for most buyers. In the Canary Islands, the ITP on resale properties is 6.5% of the purchase price (by comparison, many mainland regions charge 8–10%). If you buy a brand new property from a developer, ITP doesn’t apply; instead you’d pay VAT (known as IGIC in the Canaries) which is 7% in Lanzarote, plus a small document tax (AJD). We will advise which tax applies to your purchase and the amount.</li>
            <li class="white-text"><strong>Notary and Land Registry Fees:</strong> These are the fees for the public notary to execute the deed and for the official registration of your title. They are government-regulated and depend on the property price (higher price, slightly higher fee). Together, notary + registry fees are usually around 1% of the purchase price (sometimes a bit more for lower-priced properties, as there are minimum tariffs).</li>
            <li class="white-text"><strong>Stamp Duty (AJD – Actos Jurídicos Documentados):</strong> This is a tax on the act of officially documenting the sale, essentially on the notarized deed. In Lanzarote (and all Canary Islands) the stamp duty is 0.75% of the purchase price (for new property purchases with VAT, stamp duty is 0.75% on top of the VAT). For resale properties, some Canary Islands cabildos (governments) also charge 0.75% stamp duty on the notary deed; effectively this means in Lanzarote you might encounter a 0.75% charge in addition to the 6.5% transfer tax. (Mainland regions often have a higher stamp duty around 1.0–1.5%.)</li>
            <li class="white-text"><strong>Legal Fees:</strong> This is our fee for handling your conveyancing. We are very transparent about our fees from the outset. Legal fees can vary depending on the complexity, but approximately 1% of the property price is a common estimate (plus VAT, which in our case is IGIC at 7%). We will quote you a fixed fee whenever possible, so you know the cost upfront.</li>
            <li class="white-text"><strong>Other Miscellaneous Costs:</strong> These include things like mortgage arrangement fees (if you are getting a Spanish mortgage, the bank may charge a fee or you may need to pay for a valuation survey), courier charges, and translation fees if applicable. The mortgage costs can range but often total around 1–2% of the loan amount (banks sometimes add it into the loan). If you are not taking a mortgage, you save on those. We always provide a breakdown of expected costs specific to your deal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="white-text">In summary, for a rough calculation, many buyers use ~10% extra as a safe cushion. For example, if you agree to buy a property at €200,000, budget an additional €16,000–€20,000 for taxes and fees in Lanzarote. The good news is Canary Islands have slightly lower taxes than some other parts of Spain, and we’ll make sure you understand all costs beforehand. There are no hidden charges when you work with us – we’ll outline everything so you can budget properly.</p>

            <h3 class="white-text">What taxes do I pay when selling a property in Lanzarote?</h3>
            <p class="white-text">If you sell a property in Lanzarote, there are two main taxes to be aware of, plus a special withholding for non-resident sellers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="white-text"><strong>Plusvalía Municipal:</strong> This is a local tax on the increase in the land value of your property since you bought it. It's imposed by the town hall (ayuntamiento) where the property is located. The plusvalía is calculated based on the cadastral value of the land (not the sale price) and the number of years you owned the property. Essentially, the longer you owned it and the higher the official land value, the more this tax will be. Each municipality sets its rates per year of ownership. Typically, the seller is liable for the Plusvalía tax (unless you negotiated otherwise in the contract). The amount could be a few hundred euros for short ownership periods, up to several thousand euros for long-term owners in high-value areas. We will request a calculation from the town hall or use online tools to estimate this for you before you sell, so you can budget for it. After completion, we can file the plusvalía return and ensure it's paid on time (within 30 days of sale) to avoid penalties.</li>
                <li class="white-text"><strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT):</strong> This is the tax on the profit you make from selling your property. The profit (or gain) is basically the difference between your selling price and what you originally paid for the property (taking into account certain allowable expenses like purchase costs or improvements). If you sell as a non-resident (e.g. you live in the UK and are not tax-resident in Spain), the capital gains tax rate is 19% for EU/EEA citizens and 24% for non-EU citizens. Since Brexit, British sellers are in the 24% category. If you sell as a Spanish tax resident, the gain is taxed on a sliding scale: 19% on the first ~€6,000 of gain, 21% on the portion of gain up to ~€50,000, 23% beyond that (these brackets adjust slightly each year). There are some exemptions: for instance, Spanish residents over 65 who sell their primary home might be exempt, and if you reinvest in another Spanish property, you can defer/reduce the tax. We will advise based on your specific circumstances.</li>
                <li class="white-text"><strong>3% Withholding for Non-Residents:</strong> When a non-resident sells property in Spain, the buyer is required to withhold 3% of the sale price and pay it directly to the Spanish Tax Agency as a withholding towards the seller’s CGT. For example, if you sell your Lanzarote villa for €300,000 and you are not a Spanish resident, the buyer will pay €9,000 (which is 3% of 300k) to the tax authorities, and you would receive €291,000 (the rest) at closing. This 3% is not an extra tax, but an advance payment of your CGT. You then have to file a special tax form (Modelo 210) to declare your actual capital gain. If your 3% withholding (€9,000 in this example) is more than the CGT due, you can claim a refund for the difference. If it’s less, you pay the additional amount. The refund process can take a few months, but we will handle the paperwork to make sure you get back what you’re owed. Spanish residents do not have this 3% withheld, since they’ll pay any CGT in their annual tax return. Our lawyers will manage all these tax filings for you after the sale, so although the buyer’s lawyer might handle the 3% payment at closing, we’ll take care of the follow-up to calculate your final tax bill and submit for any refund due.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="white-text">In summary, as a seller you need to budget for Plusvalía (municipal land tax) and Capital Gains Tax on your profit. The exact amounts depend on your situation (how long you owned the property, your residency status, and how much profit you made). We will calculate these for you in advance and plan the most tax-efficient way to handle your sale. Our goal is that you know your net proceeds after all taxes, so there are no surprises. After completing the sale, we’ll also assist with the necessary tax forms to finalize your obligations in Spain.</p>

        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
          <p>Puerto del Carmen's property market is particularly active, with a mix of holiday homes, rental investments, and permanent residences. Spain's property conveyancing system is very different from the UK's, so having a qualified local lawyer is crucial. In Spain, buyers are expected to do thorough due diligence – checking for debts, building permits, tourist licenses, and property registrations – before completing a sale. Without a lawyer, you risk overlooking critical issues specific to Puerto del Carmen's tourism-focused market.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
          <p>It's strongly recommended (even by UK government guidance) to choose an independent Spanish property lawyer who represents only you. Unlike in the UK, Spanish notaries are public officials who impartially oversee the signing of property deeds – they do not advise the buyer or verify if the property is problem-free. Only your own lawyer will conduct a full legal audit of the property, check tourist licensing requirements for rental properties, and handle contract negotiations solely on your behalf. In Puerto del Carmen's fast-moving market, proceeding without dedicated legal counsel is extremely risky.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
          <p>Spanish property law is significantly different from UK property law, making professional legal representation essential. Unlike in the UK, Spanish notaries are public officials who oversee the signing process but do not provide legal advice or protect your interests. You need your own independent lawyer to conduct due diligence, verify property titles, check for debts, and ensure all legal requirements are met.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-12">
          <p>Our experienced property lawyers conduct comprehensive legal checks, including land registry searches, debt verification, planning permission validation, and community fee reviews. We protect you from common pitfalls such as illegal constructions, outstanding debts, or planning violations that could affect your property investment. With Roper Lawyers, you can proceed with confidence knowing every legal aspect is thoroughly examined.</p>

          <p>New build properties in Spain must be properly registered with Spanish authorities to ensure legal ownership and compliance with building regulations. The new build declaration process involves verifying building permits, confirming construction compliance, and registering the completed property with the Land Registry. Without proper registration, you may face difficulties selling, mortgaging, or even legally occupying your property.</p>

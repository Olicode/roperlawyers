        <p class="text-muted mb-4"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 29, 2026 | <strong>Legal Review:</strong> Roper Lawyers</p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          The legal landscape for holiday home owners in Spain and the Canary Islands has shifted. Under
          <strong>Real Decreto 1312/2024</strong> and the landmark <strong>Canarian Law on Sustainable Planning (Ley 6/2025)</strong>,
          the era of informal registration has ended.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          <strong>Are you ready for the March 2nd deadline?</strong> To keep your listings active on Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo,
          you must now move from simple registration into the mandatory Annual Reporting Phase.

          <h2 class="h3 mb-3" style="color: #b39c84;">1. URGENT: The February 2026 N2 Reporting Deadline</h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Under <strong>Ministerial Order VAU/1560/2025</strong>, all property owners with a National Rental Registration Number
            (NRA/NRUA) must complete their first <strong>Annual Informative Declaration</strong> (the N2 "Data Deposit").
          </p>
          <ul class="mb-3">
            <li><strong>Filing Window:</strong> February 1st – March 2nd, 2026.</li>
            <li><strong>The Mandate:</strong> You must report all booking activity from the 2025 calendar year, including stay dates, guest counts, and the purpose of stay (Tourism, Work, Study, or Medical).</li>
            <li><strong>The Penalty:</strong> Failure to file results in the immediate revocation of your NRA number. Once revoked, online platforms are legally barred from hosting your listing.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="h3 mb-3" style="color: #b39c84;">2. The Three Pillars of Legal Compliance in 2026</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">To operate legally in the Canary Islands, your property must now satisfy three distinct layers of law:</p>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h3 class="h5 mb-2">Pillar 1: The National Layer (NRA/NRUA)</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Real Decreto 1312/2024</strong> requires every short-term rental unit (under 12 months) to be registered with the
              Spanish Land Registry. This generates your <strong>Número de Registro Único de Alquiler (NRA)</strong>, which must be
              displayed on all digital ads.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h3 class="h5 mb-2">Pillar 2: The Regional Layer (VV License &amp; Classified Activity)</h3>
            <p>
              The <strong>Decreto 113/2015</strong> remains the baseline. You must hold a valid <strong>Vivienda Vacacional (VV) License</strong>.
              Crucially for 2026: Municipalities are now auditing for "Classified Activity" permits. Even if you have a VV license,
              lacking this municipal permit can lead to license suspension.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h3 class="h5 mb-2">Pillar 3: The Sustainable Planning Layer (Ley 6/2025)</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">This new law introduces strict limits to protect local housing:</p>
            <ul class="mb-3">
              <li><strong>10-Year Age Limit:</strong> Buildings must be 10+ years old to be eligible for <em>new</em> licenses.</li>
              <li><strong>90% Residential Reserve:</strong> Licenses are capped at 10% of total housing in most municipalities.</li>
              <li><strong>Community Veto:</strong> Under the <strong>Horizontal Property Law (LPH)</strong>, your community of owners can now prohibit rentals with a 3/5ths (60%) majority vote.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h3 mb-3" style="color: #b39c84;">3. Mandatory Guest Registration (SES.HOSPEDAJES)</h2>
          <p class="mb-3">
            As of December 2024, the national <strong>SES.HOSPEDAJES</strong> platform (<strong>Real Decreto 933/2021</strong>) replaced
            older regional systems.
          </p>
          <ul class="mb-3">
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> All guests over 14 must be registered within 24 hours of arrival.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> This system is mandatory for National Security and is independent of your tax or tourist reporting.</li>
          </ul>
